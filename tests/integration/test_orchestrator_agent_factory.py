"""Integration: assemble the BeeAI RequirementAgent via the orchestrator_agent
context manager.

Discovers ML tools via MCP (live in-process server), converts the bundle's
local tools to BeeAI Tools, and yields a fully wired `RequirementAgent`
with the system prompt and memory configured.

We pass a fake ChatModel (no real LLM call) — these tests only verify that
the agent has the expected tool surface and configuration. Live LLM calls
happen in `scripts/orchestrator_smoke.py`.
