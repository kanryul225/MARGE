"""Local tool: emit the final response to the user.

The single terminal tool. The orchestrator writes a natural-language
`response` here — covering positive recommendations, abstentions
("cannot reliably advise — please see a doctor"), or follow-up
questions ("please provide HbA1c, recent mammogram, family history").

Gating is handled at the LLM-planning layer by `MARGEProtocolRequirement`
in `apps/orchestrator/requirements/marge_protocol.py`. This module also
keeps a small middleware-side check (`enforce_protocol`) as a defensive
backstop in case any caller invokes the tool outside the agent loop.
