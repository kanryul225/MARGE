"""MARGE Protocol Requirement (custom BeeAI Requirement).

Encodes architecture.md §2 plus the role-aware extensions agreed in the
agent_fix slice. Single requirement, four rules:

  A. predict_* tools are disallowed until consult_medical_expert was
     called successfully at least once. The expert decides which conditions
     to consider; the orchestrator translates that into specific ML calls.
  B. clinical_report (terminal) needs at least one predict_* AND at least
     one consult_medical_expert in the trajectory.
  C. abstain (terminal) needs at least one consult_medical_expert. This
     covers the "expert says nothing in our ML scope is suspected" path.
  D. request_more_info (terminal) is always allowed — the orchestrator may
     ask the user for additional data at any point.
  E. The agent cannot terminate (prevent_stop=True on every terminal) until
     at least one of {clinical_report, abstain, request_more_info} has been
     called. The intermediate `update_user` tool is unrestricted and never
     terminates the loop.

Order between predict_* and consult_medical_expert beyond rule A is
intentionally unconstrained — the orchestrator can re-consult the expert
after running ML, run more ML after expert validation, etc.

Helper functions `has_any_ml_prediction` and `has_consulted_expert` are
exposed for tests and for ad-hoc inspection of an agent state.
