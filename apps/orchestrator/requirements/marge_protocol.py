"""MARGE Protocol Requirement (custom BeeAI Requirement).

Hybrid pattern (post-`agent_fix` refactor): casual chat is plain
natural-language `content` from the LLM and ends the turn with **no tool
call**. Only structured outputs that the UI must render as cards are
expressed as terminal tools — the surface is now four:

  A. predict_* tools are disallowed until consult_medical_expert was
     called successfully at least once. The expert decides which conditions
     to consider; the orchestrator translates that into specific ML calls.
  B. clinical_report (terminal) needs at least one predict_* AND at least
     one consult_medical_expert in the trajectory.
  C. abstain (terminal) needs at least one consult_medical_expert. This
     covers the "expert says nothing in our ML scope is suspected" path.
  D. request_more_info (terminal) is always allowed — the orchestrator may
     ask the user for additional data at any point.

There is no `prevent_stop` rule any more. A natural-language reply with
no tool call is a perfectly valid turn ending (a chatbot saying "hi
back"). The prompt steers the model toward picking the right structured
terminal when one is appropriate.

Order between predict_* and consult_medical_expert beyond rule A is
intentionally unconstrained — the orchestrator can re-consult the expert
after running ML, run more ML after expert validation, etc.

Helper functions `has_any_ml_prediction` and `has_consulted_expert` are
exposed for tests and for ad-hoc inspection of an agent state.
